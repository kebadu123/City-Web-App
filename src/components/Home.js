        1.	Introduction 
In Ethiopia, general education encompasses the breadth of knowledge involving the major intellectual and aesthetic skills and achievements of humanity. This is expected to include understanding and appreciation of the pluralistic nature of knowledge epitomized by the natural sciences, quantitative skills, social-behavioral sciences, humanities, and arts. To achieve and share such an understanding and appreciation, skills in self-expression, quantitative analysis, information literacy, and collaborative interaction are necessary. General Education aids students in developing intellectual curiosity, strengthened ability to think, and a deeper sense of aesthetic appreciation. General Education, in essence, aims to cultivate a knowledgeable, informed, and literate human being.
Ministry of Education provides different subjects for Ethiopian general education. From these subjects Information Technology (IT) subject is the one that provide skill and knowledge for students to be competent in the use of IT for many tasks. This subject is delivered starting form grade 7 to grade 12 with different subject content. However, the new curriculum that ministry of education launches with new technical concepts. This is difficult for teachers to deliver the subject and we proposed a skill gap training to help teachers.
According to Kombolcha regio-polytan city education bureau, there are 31 IT teachers. So, the skill gap training is proposed for these 31 IT teachers.
2.	Motivation 
Ethiopian ministry of education launches a new curriculum for all education levels. The new curriculum of IT subject encompasses new concepts and skills that teaches are unable to deliver due to skill gap. We motivated to fill this gap by giving a training for IT teachers on selected area. The team identified the following skill gap areas. These are:
•	Logic Oriented Graphics Oriented (LOGO) Programming in grade 7 and grade 8
•	Computer network and security in grade 9 and grade10
•	Fundamentals of programming in grade 9, grade 10, grade 11 and grade 12
•	Image processing and multimedia in grade 9 and grade 10
•	Database management system in grade 11 and grade 12
•	Web development in grade 11 and grade 12
•	Emerging technologies grade 11 and grade 12

3.	Objective of the Training 
3.1.	General objective 
The main objective of the training is to fill the skill gap of IT teachers.
3.2.	Specific objectives
The following are specific objectives of the training.
•	To give a training on emerging technologies
•	To give a training on image processing and multimedia
•	To give a training on computer network and security
•	To give a training on LOGO programming 
•	To give a training on Database management systems
•	To give a training on Computer programming (C++ and Python)
•	To give a training on web development 
4.	Training Methodology 
The training will be delivered with both in lectures and practical sessions depending on the training area. The following table show the training methods.
Training area 	Training Methods 
Emerging Technologies	Lecture 
Image processing and multimedia	Practical 
Computer network and security	Lecture and Practical
LOGO programming	Lecture and Practical

5.	Tools Used for the Training
The training is delivered in both lecture and practical sessions. So, the team identifies the following tools and resources.
•	Two computer laboratory classes with at least 16 computer each 
•	Projector, whiteboard, and marker
•	MSW LOGO software
•	Python programming editor software
•	C++ programming editor software
•	Sublime software for web development
